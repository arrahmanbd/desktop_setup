This guide will demonstrate how to replace Nautilus with Nemo instead of Nautilus to restore desktop icon functionality in Budgie.
##gsettings set org.nemo.desktop ignored-desktop-handlers "['budgie-helper']"
To install Nemo, execute:

pamac install nemo
To remove Nautilus, execute:

pamac remove nautilus nautilus-admin nautilus-empty-file nautilus-sendto libnautilus-extension python-nautilus
To set Nemo as the default desktop manager:

xdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory application/x-gnome-saved-search
Execute:

dconf 
Navigate to org.gnome.desktop.background

Scroll to the bottom of this setting

Set show-desktop-icons to true

Still within dconf, navigate to org.nemo.desktop and optionally set use-desktop-grid to false

If use-desktop-grid is set to true, icons on the desktop cannot be reordered- *
A trash icon can be set to appear on the desktop through the item directly above use-desktop-grid
There are a few Nautilus related options buried in the editor - they can all be safely removed
Open Budgie Desktop Settings

Navigate to Autostart

Click the + in the top right corner.

Select the Add button

The title/description can be set to whatever you like, but set the command to nemo-desktop
Now restart and enjoy having a desktop with icons in Manjaro Budgie. :slight_smile:
